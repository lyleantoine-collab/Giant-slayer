# Strains Overview: The Microbial Heroes

Off-the-shelf bacteria ready to tackle arsenic trioxide. No custom engineering needed—these are proven in labs and available today.

## Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (ATCC PTA-4588)
- **Role**: Oxidizes As(III) to less toxic As(V), then pumps it out via efflux systems. Volatilizes 10x faster than wild strains.
- **Why It Works Here**: Thrives in contaminated soils, cold-tolerant down to 4°C (dormant in winter, active in spring).
- **Source**: [ATCC PTA-4588](https://www.atcc.org/products/pta-4588) - $310 CAD/vial.
- **Key Study**: [ACS Synthetic Biology, 2014](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/sb5001137) - Demonstrates enhanced arsenic metabolism in bioreactors.
- **Safety**: BSL-1, non-pathogenic to humans/plants.

## Corynebacterium glutamicum (ATCC 13032)
- **Role**: Accumulates up to 90% of arsenic intracellularly, binding it as stable complexes to prevent leaching.
- **Why It Works Here**: Industrial workhorse—grows fast on cheap media, sequesters heavy metals without die-off.
- **Source**: [ATCC 13032](https://www.atcc.org/products/13032) - $310 CAD/vial.
- **Key Study**: [Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, 2022](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00253-022-11945-6) - 90% uptake in soil simulations.
- **Safety**: BSL-1, GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) by FDA.

## Combo Rationale
- **Synergy**: P. putida preps the arsenic (oxidation), C. glutamicum mops it up (sequestration). Lab co-cultures show 70%+ reduction in 3-6 months.
- **Culture Notes**: Inoculate 1:1 ratio in LB media, 30°C, 200 rpm shake. Yield: 10^10 CFU/g pellets.
- **References Folder**: PDFs of studies attached (or link DOIs for open access).

These bugs are nature's slingshot—grab 'em, brew 'em, deploy 'em.
