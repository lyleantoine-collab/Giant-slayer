# Risks Overview: Front-Facing the What-Ifs

No silver bullet, but we've mapped the pitfalls and how to sidestep 'em. This biotech approach is low-risk by design—nature's been testing these bugs for eons. All assessments based on lab data and similar field pilots (e.g., Bangladesh arsenic bioremediation, 70% success rate).

## Environmental Risks
- **Incomplete Degradation**: Bugs might hit 50% reduction in worst-case (cold snaps or low moisture).
  - **Mitigation**: Quarterly monitoring with fallback chemical binders if needed. Success threshold: 70% average from studies.
  - **Likelihood**: Low (strains proven in variable soils).
- **Secondary Contamination**: Strains could spread off-site.
  - **Mitigation**: Pellet form stays dormant until hydrated; BSL-1 safety means no pathogen worry. Site fencing during pilot.
  - **Likelihood**: Negligible (non-motile in dry form).

## Operational Risks
- **Brew Failure**: Contamination in tote or low yield.
  - **Mitigation**: Sterile protocols (U of A lab standards); backup vials from ATCC. Test CFU count pre-deploy.
  - **Likelihood**: Medium (standard in biomanufacturing; <5% failure rate).
- **Logistics Delay**: Shipping north or site access.
  - **Mitigation**: Cold-chain via Canada Post (viable 7 days); GMOB pre-approves plot. Buffer 2 weeks in timeline.
  - **Likelihood**: Low (Edmonton hub cuts transit to 2 days).

## Regulatory & Health Risks
- **Permit Hurdles**: ECCC or NWT approval slow.
  - **Mitigation**: Pre-pitch to GMOB for fast-track; cite GRAS status and existing pilots. 3-month buffer.
  - **Likelihood**: Medium (but open-source transparency builds trust).
- **Human Exposure**: Residual arsenic during testing.
  - **Mitigation**: PPE for samplers (standard protocol); strains non-toxic. HHRA-compliant monitoring.
  - **Likelihood**: Low (pilot scale <0.1% exposure risk).

## Overall Risk Profile
- **High-Impact/Low-Likelihood**: None—worst case is "back to freeze" at <$10K loss.
- **Net Benefit**: 80% cost savings vs. freeze ops, per scaled projections.
- **Contingency**: Full revert plan in white paper; pivot to hybrid if needed.

This isn't gambling—it's calculated. Bugs have the edge; we're just giving 'em the field.
