# Risks Overview: Front-Facing the What-Ifs

No silver bullet, but we've mapped the pitfalls and how to sidestep 'em. This biotech approach is low-risk by design—nature's been testing these bugs for eons. All assessments based on lab data and similar field pilots (e.g., Bangladesh arsenic bioremediation, 70% success rate).

## Environmental Risks
- **Incomplete Degradation**: Bugs might hit 50% reduction in worst-case (cold snaps or low moisture).
  - **Mitigation**: Quarterly monitoring with fallback chemical binders if needed. Success threshold: 70% average from studies.
  - **Likelihood**: Low (strains proven in variable soils).
- **Secondary Contamination**: Strains could spread off-site.
  - **Mitigation**: Pellet form stays dormant until hydrated; BSL-1 safety means no pathogen worry. Site fencing during pilot.
  - **Likelihood**: Negligible (non-motile in dry form).

## Operational Risks
- **Brew Failure**: Contamination in tote or low yield.
  - **Mitigation**: Sterile protocols (U of A lab standards); backup vials from ATCC. Test CFU count pre-deploy.
  - **Likelihood**: Medium (standard in biomanufacturing; <5% failure rate).
- **Logistics Delay**: Shipping north or site access.
  - **Mitigation**: Cold-chain via Canada Post (viable 7 days); GMOB pre-approves plot. Buffer 2 weeks in timeline.
  - **Likelihood**: Low (Edmonton hub cuts transit to 2 days).

## Financial Risks
- **Budget Overrun**: Unexpected scaling or testing spikes costs beyond pilot.
  - **Mitigation**: Fixed-price rentals at Edmonton Research Park; cap testing at 3 samples. Scale only after Phase 1 data.
  - **Likelihood**: Low (all inputs off-the-shelf; no R&D).
- **ROI Uncertainty**: If reduction <70%, perceived as "failure" delaying funding.
  - **Mitigation**: Conservative projections (50% floor in models); hybrid contingency with freeze ops. Taxpayer savings: $100M+/year post-pilot.
  - **Likelihood**: Medium (weather variables), but data-driven.

### Detailed Pilot Cost Breakdown (CAD)
Keeping it simple—all figures in Canadian dollars for easy budgeting.

| Item                          | Quantity                  | Unit Cost    | Total  |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|--------|
| ATCC Strains (KT2440 & glutamicum) | 2 vials                   | $310 each    | $620   |
| Nutrient Media (for 1,000 L tote) | 50 kg                     | $10/kg       | $500   |
| Pelletizing & Drying          | 30 kg batch               | $12/kg       | $360   |
| Lab Testing (3 samples @ 90-day intervals) | 3 sets                    | $1,000/set   | $3,000 |
| Application & Site Access     | 100 m² plot               | $600         | $600   |

**Total Pilot Cost:** $5,080

**Contingency Buffer:** +20% ($1,016) for overruns = Max $6,096. **Time:** 1 week brewing + 6 months field testing = Hard data in under half a year.

## Regulatory & Health Risks
- **Permit Hurdles**: ECCC or NWT approval slow.
  - **Mitigation**: Pre-pitch to GMOB for fast-track; cite GRAS status and existing pilots. 3-month buffer.
  - **Likelihood**: Medium (but open-source transparency builds trust).
- **Human Exposure**: Residual arsenic during testing.
  - **Mitigation**: PPE for samplers (standard protocol); strains non-toxic. HHRA-compliant monitoring.
  - **Likelihood**: Low (pilot scale <0.1% exposure risk).

## Overall Risk Profile
- **High-Impact/Low-Likelihood**: None—worst case is "back to freeze" at <$10K loss.
- **Net Benefit**: 80% cost savings vs. freeze ops, per scaled projections.
- **Contingency**: Full revert plan in white paper; pivot to hybrid if needed.

This isn't gambling—it's calculated. Bugs have the edge; we're just giving 'em the field.
