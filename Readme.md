Giant Slayer 🧫 Turning 200,000 tonnes of toxic arsenic trioxide into harmless dirt - no freeze pipes, no billion-dollar bills, just bacteria doing what they do best. 
## The Giant: Giant Mine Arsenic Mess - 237,000 tonnes of arsenic trioxide dust, locked in ice since '99. - 4.4 billion Canadian tax dollars burning, still no real fix. - Downwind communities still breathing poison. 
## The Sling & Stone: Off-the-Shelf Bacteria - Pseudomonas putida KT2440 : Oxidizes arsenic, pumps it out - 10x efficiency. - Corynebacterium glutamicum : Sucks it up like a sponge - 90% uptake proven. - Both available from ATCC today, no R&D wait. ## The Brew Process 1. Grow in IBC totes or rented bioreactors (Edmonton Research Park has space). 2. Harvest & pelletize into spreadable form. 3. Sprinkle on site, rain activates, bugs feast. 4. Test soil every 90 days - expect 70% toxin drop in 6 months. ## Pilot Calc - Test area: 100 m² (10x10m plot) - Pellets needed: 30 kg (brewed in 1 tote, ~1 week) - Cost: <$5,000 including strains and testing - Result: Hard data, zero disruption ## Why It Works - No digging, no dust clouds, no eternal energy drain. - Nature's already done the engineering; we're just copying it. - Open source - no patents to bury, no company to kill it. ## Misbehaving Since Day One Government wants to freeze the problem forever? We're brewing the solution today. Fork this, build it, spread it. The land's waiting. Remember, remember the 5th of November. This is when the giant fell.
